* emacs-tut : opinionated emacs tutorial in three steps

1) [[file:emacs-primer.org]] : In Finnish, my personal view how emacs
   keybings should be presented - TL;DR; C-g and C-h are the only keys
   you need to know ;)
2) [[file:org-primer.org]] : Primer helping to understand emacs and
   org-mode. Includes some examples. This is *NOT* the way to
   configure emacs - it is intended to help in understanding workings
   of emacs and especially org-mode.
3) [[file:emacs-admin.org]] : The first version for your own emacs
   configuration (the file, which should be expanded when
   understanding of capabilieties increase)
